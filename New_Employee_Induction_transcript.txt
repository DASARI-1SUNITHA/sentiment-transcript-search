[00:00 - 00:10]  Beginning with the first topic, what is induction and what are the types of induction program?
[00:10 - 00:16]  Employee induction is the program where the new employees introduce to the organization
[00:16 - 00:17]  they will be working for.
[00:17 - 00:23]  It is an onboarding program where the new hire learns about the values and culture of
[00:23 - 00:25]  their organization and their role.
[00:25 - 00:31]  A good induction program is a well-defined and interactive training program in order
[00:31 - 00:35]  to make the new employee comfortable in the new environment.
[00:35 - 00:38]  Now let's see the types of induction process.
[00:38 - 00:42]  Broadly this process is divided into two types.
[00:42 - 00:44]  First type is the formal induction.
[00:44 - 00:49]  It is a planned attempt to introduce new employees to the organization, jobs and the
[00:49 - 00:50]  working environment.
[00:50 - 00:55]  In this method, there are more chances to win the new employee's loyalty at the very
[00:55 - 01:01]  beginning and also new employee will have the chance to carry his or her work clearly
[01:01 - 01:07]  with less number of errors and they will fit to the organization culture and the work
[01:07 - 01:09]  group easily and strong.
[01:09 - 01:11]  Second is the informal induction.
[01:11 - 01:14]  This is not planned and is on ad hoc basis.
[01:14 - 01:19]  The new employees learn through a hit and trial method in this process.
[01:19 - 01:23]  They get familiar with work and work environment by themselves.
[01:23 - 01:27]  This type will make the stress on new employee at the very beginning because of his or
[01:27 - 01:30]  her not knowing things at the operations.
[01:30 - 01:35]  The new employee may leave the organization and the company may need to follow the entire
[01:35 - 01:39]  recruiting process again.
[01:39 - 01:42]  A typical induction program may include five phases.
[01:42 - 01:46]  These can vary depending upon the organization.
[01:46 - 01:51]  The first phases pre-arrival phase, this includes the preparations done before the joining of
[01:51 - 01:58]  the new employee like sending out necessary communications related to the joining process.
[01:58 - 01:59]  Second is the orientation phase.
[01:59 - 02:05]  This involves welcoming the new employee, introducing with existing employees, providing
[02:05 - 02:10]  them overview of the organization's structure, policies, etc.
[02:10 - 02:11]  Third phase is the training.
[02:11 - 02:16]  This means providing the new employee with skills and knowledge they need to perform their
[02:16 - 02:17]  role effectively.
[02:17 - 02:22]  Fourth is the integration phase which means helping the new employee become part of the
[02:22 - 02:26]  team and the broader organization.
[02:26 - 02:31]  The last phase is known as evaluation phase which means assessing or follow up about
[02:31 - 02:37]  the effectiveness of induction program and making necessary adjustments for future employees.
[02:37 - 02:43]  Moving on to the second part of the video that is who is responsible to conduct this program.
[02:43 - 02:46]  A mix of people can carry out the induction process.
[02:46 - 02:51]  It is advised and best for the HR department to lead the process but it doesn't mean that
[02:51 - 02:56]  the entire responsibility of the induction process should be left on the HR department
[02:56 - 02:57]  only.
[02:57 - 03:02]  However, they are responsible to share some necessary details related to the department
[03:02 - 03:04]  and related to the employer.
[03:04 - 03:10]  But it is always advised for the managers to be involved into this induction process
[03:10 - 03:15]  because they will be able to help the new employee adjust into the new work culture and
[03:15 - 03:20]  will be able to set up the expectations with their new role.
[03:20 - 03:25]  On the other hand, the team members can also contribute a lot while adjusting into this
[03:25 - 03:30]  new environment because they are the ones who will be able to help that new member to
[03:30 - 03:36]  adjust into the new team and into the new work environment more quickly.
[03:36 - 03:40]  Now the third part of the video that is the Benefits of induction program.
[03:40 - 03:46]  Adopting an induction process for new starters can have many benefits for both employers and
[03:46 - 03:47]  employees.
[03:47 - 03:53]  Let us first understand the benefits of this induction process for the organization.
[03:53 - 03:58]  The first benefit says that it contribute to a positive workplace culture as it assists
[03:58 - 04:04]  the new employees to transition and assimilate into the workplace.
[04:04 - 04:10]  Secondly, it saves an employer's time and money as the employees can partially self-educate
[04:10 - 04:13]  through online learning modules.
[04:13 - 04:15]  Next it also encourages employer retention.
[04:15 - 04:20]  It reduces employer turnover and save on recruitment cost as it helps employees feel
[04:20 - 04:23]  welcome and value.
[04:23 - 04:28]  It also ensures operational efficiency and increases productivity as the employees have a
[04:28 - 04:34]  full understanding of the company and their role within it so they can hit the ground
[04:34 - 04:35]  running.
[04:35 - 04:42]  Lastly and the most important benefit is that it enhances company reputation by creating
[04:42 - 04:46]  a professional impression in front of new joiners.
[04:46 - 04:49]  Now let's see the benefits of induction process for new staff.
[04:49 - 04:55]  The first benefit says that it helps the new employees to settle into their role quickly.
[04:55 - 05:00]  Secondly, with the help of induction process, new hires better understand their role and
[05:00 - 05:04]  how it fits into the organization.
[05:04 - 05:09]  Next the new starters feel respected and valued and accepted into the organization by team
[05:09 - 05:10]  members.
[05:10 - 05:17]  Then with the help of induction process, new employees better understand company processes,
[05:17 - 05:19]  policies and procedures.
[05:19 - 05:25]  Lastly, the induction process helps to establish a good communication with managers and team
[05:25 - 05:26]  members.
[05:26 - 05:30]  Now moving on to the next part of the video that is what all topics are covered in the
[05:30 - 05:33]  induction checklist.
[05:33 - 05:38]  There are four major topics to be included in the checklist that is the organizational
[05:38 - 05:44]  information, employee benefits, introduction and job responsibilities.
[05:44 - 05:49]  As you can see, the sub topics to be covered under these four heads and accordingly the
[05:49 - 05:56]  line managers and the HR member designates the training sessions to the new joiners.
[05:56 - 06:01]  Here is the fourth part of this video that is how to make the induction plan an achievement.
[06:01 - 06:06]  To plan your induction before the joining of a new member is always beneficial and to
[06:06 - 06:12]  plan it effectively is much better because this is the first impression about your company
[06:12 - 06:14]  that he or she will create.
[06:14 - 06:18]  As your induction process has to be completely impressive.
[06:18 - 06:23]  So here are few strategies by adopting which you can plan your induction in an impressive
[06:23 - 06:24]  manner.
[06:24 - 06:28]  Let's understand them in detail.
[06:28 - 06:33]  The most important step as you all know is to prepare your presentation which can easily
[06:33 - 06:37]  be done through various creative mediums available on internet.
[06:37 - 06:42]  Thanks to the AI techniques now where you can create an impressive presentation with less
[06:42 - 06:44]  efforts and less time.
[06:44 - 06:48]  But make sure that your presentation is not very long and not filled with too much of
[06:48 - 06:51]  content that can make the audience feel bored.
[06:51 - 06:57]  It has to be complete with necessary information and shot at the same time.
[06:57 - 07:01]  Next you can plan the introduction session with different department heads of your company
[07:01 - 07:05]  like accounts, ID, administration, legal etc.
[07:05 - 07:10]  These department heads can help the new member to understand their applicability to his job
[07:10 - 07:12]  role in the organization.
[07:12 - 07:17]  You can probably help them to design presentations to look at more creative.
[07:17 - 07:22]  Next you can also plan to have some motivational videos for the new members to give them an
[07:22 - 07:25]  inspiration in the new environment.
[07:25 - 07:30]  The most important step can be to arrange for the introduction meeting with the team members
[07:30 - 07:32]  and the team head draw managers.
[07:32 - 07:37]  This will help the new member to have clear understanding on work culture, his or her
[07:37 - 07:40]  role and other associated things.
[07:40 - 07:44]  Now the most important point to remember here is that while planning all these things
[07:44 - 07:49]  don't forget to plan for breaks in between like tea or snacks, break or lunch or dinner
[07:49 - 07:50]  break.
[07:50 - 07:54]  This will help them to get refreshed from the next session you planned.
[07:54 - 07:59]  After conducting all these formal steps you can take them for the facility tour that
[07:59 - 08:04]  is show them your office, introduce them to the other staff members, introduce them
[08:04 - 08:07]  to the office facilities etc.
[08:07 - 08:11]  In the end you can plan to conduct the revision to your induction process in the form of
[08:11 - 08:16]  some quiz in order to analyze the success rate of your induction plan.
[08:16 - 08:22]  Don't forget to take the induction feedback for each new employee because this is helpful
[08:22 - 08:26]  for further progress of your department and team.
[08:26 - 08:32]  Also I would like to add an important tip or suggestion that is to share your entire induction
[08:32 - 08:37]  plan in the beginning itself and make your new hire aware of the engagements you have
[08:37 - 08:41]  planned for them for the whole day and next day as well.
